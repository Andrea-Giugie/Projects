## String Evaluation
These two Java file grants you to evaluate almost any well formatted string, into a number.

## How to
In order make this evaluation work, you need to put a space in between every character

Example:

```
calc c = new calc();
Object[] o;
o = "sqrt ( ( 16 + 4 ) * 2 + 24 )".split(" ");
        
String s = c.esegui(o).toString();
System.out.println(s);
```
This string should display 8.0
